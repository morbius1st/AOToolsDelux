    This document describes Delux Measure and the Unit Style apps <br>
    <h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
    I am sure that you find the standard measure tool a bit
    lacking as the measured distance is only the direct XY distance. I know
    that frequently, I want separate X &amp; Y distance and using the
    standard measure tool means either measuring twice or placing a
    temporary dimension - not the most efficient system. <br>
    <br>
    Which is why I created,<strong> Delux Measure.<br></strong>&nbsp;<br>
    With <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delux Measure</span>,
    you can pick two points and get the full range of
    geometric distances between the points (within the limitations imposed
    by Revit<sup><small>ï¿½</small></sup> - more on
    this below). &nbsp;This includes the X, Y, and Z
    distances as well as the 4 diagonal distances XY, XZ,YZ, and, of course
    XYZ. &nbsp;These distances are presented using a unit style of your
    choice (and design - more on this below) as well as an secondary unit
    style. &nbsp;I find this most helpful when working on site plans
    since the Architectural site plans will, typically, use a Feet and
    Fractional unit style but the Civil Engineer's plans use Decimal Feet.
    &nbsp;The conversion math is simple but tedious having to convert
    each time. &nbsp;Having two unit systems at the same time greatly
    simplifies this task.
    <h3>Interface</h3>
    Once installed and loaded, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delux
      Measure</span> creates a single split ribbon
    button with Unit Style shortcuts. &nbsp;In addition, there is a
    drop down with two buttons - the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delux
      Measure</span> command and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Unit
      Styles Manager</span>. &nbsp;At first, having the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delux Measure</span>
    commend
    placed on the drop down, seems to not make sense. &nbsp;But I have
    a reason for this ... &nbsp;To get the most out of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delux Measure</span>, I
    think you will want to access it quickly. &nbsp;To do this, my
    expectation is that you create a keyboard shortcut. &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Create a keyboard shortcut, if you do not already know how,select
    the&nbsp;View tab &#9658; User Interface
    Button &#9658; Keyboard Shortcuts command (at bottom of the list). &nbsp;
    Search for "<span style="font-style: italic;">CsDeluxMeasure</span>".
    &nbsp;This should find a single entry: "<span style="font-style: italic;">External Tools:CsDeluxMeasure</span>".
    &nbsp;Select this item and assign a shortcut - I use "<span style="font-weight: bold;">DX</span>" myself.
    &nbsp;Once you've done and saved this, you can access <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delux Measure</span>
    without using a ribbon button by just typing DX in most situations -
    this is the most efficient method.<br>
    <h3>Unit Styles</h3>
    One of the main fextures is unit-styles. A unit style is a group of
    distance unit settings saved and named for future reference. Unit
    styles are created, organized, and saved using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Styles Manager</span>.<br>
    <br>
    Unit styles are used in two ways.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>in the Ribbon Button</li>
      <li>in the Delux Measure window</li>
    </ul>
    Each of these is described below.
    <h3>Components</h3>
    As
    noted, there are three primary parts - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delux Measure</span>, the <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">Ribbon Button</span>
    with Unit Style shortcuts, and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Unit
      Styles Manager</span>.<br>
    <br>
    The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ribbon Button</span>
    with Unit Style Shortcuts is described below.<br>
    <br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">Delux
        Measure</span>.</a> &nbsp;<br>
    And, select this to get
    information about the <a href="Delux%20Measure%20Intro%20Help.htm"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unit
        Styles</span></a>
    editor.<br>
    <br>
    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Ribbon Button <span class="notbold">with
        Unit Styles</span></h2>
    <hr id="hrredline">
    <hr id="hrbar" width="305">The ribbon button,
    pictured here, shows an example of what it would
    look like:<br>
    <br>
    <div id="containflexbox">
      <div id="child-flexbox"><img style="width: 128px; height: 102px;" alt="Ribbon Button Image"
          src="Delux%20Measure%20Intro%20Help_files/RibbonButton.png"></div>
      <div id="child-flexbox">The Ribbon Button is a
        split-button with the last selected unit-style showing.
        &nbsp;Pressing this button changes the project distance units the
        the values saved in the unit style. This allows you to quickly switch
        between distance unit settings.<br>
        Maybe you are thinking - why would I need to change the project
        distance unit settings. Fair question. I found this
        to be very helpful in these situations. I'm sure you can think of
        others:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>When workiing on a family type, it makes more sense to have
            the project units be fractional inches or decimal inches rather than
            feet and fractional inches. &nbsp;This happens a lot for me when
            working on smaller items such as balusters, or other small component.</li>
          <li>Needing to switch between Imperial and Metric</li>
          <li>When working on a site plan and having to croordinate with
            drawings from a civil engineer who uses decimal feet.</li>
        </ul>
        Below the Ribbon Button is the drop-down which contains the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Unit Styles
          Manager</span> and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delux Measure</span>.
